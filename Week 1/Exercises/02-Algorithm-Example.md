# Algorithm Example

**Algorithm for Writing Computer Programs.**

1. Define the problem.

2. Develop a solution to the problem (Algorithm and Flowchart).

3. Perform a desk check (or dry run).

4. Code the program.

5. Verify and debug the program.

6. Document the program.

7. Perform program maintenance.

   

   **Pseudocode**

```pseudocode
1. Define the problem to be solved by the computer program.

2. Develop a solution to the problem:
   a. Create a detailed algorithm that outlines the steps the program needs to take to solve the problem.
   b. Create a flowchart to visually represent the algorithm.

3. Perform a desk check:
   a. Go through the algorithm step by step with sample inputs.
   b. Verify that the flowchart follows the same steps as the algorithm.

4. Write the source code:
   a. Use the algorithm and flowchart to guide the implementation of the program in a programming language.
   b. Follow best practices for code organization and formatting.

5. Test the program:
   a. Develop a set of test cases that cover a range of possible inputs and expected outputs.
   b. Run the program with the test cases and compare the actual output to the expected output.
   c. Debug any issues that arise during testing.

6. Document the program:
   a. Add comments to the code to explain its purpose, logic, and any complex sections.
   b. Write a user manual that provides instructions on how to use the program.
   c. Include any necessary legal or copyright information.

7. Perform program maintenance:
   a. Monitor the program for issues that arise during use.
   b. Update the program to fix any issues or add new features.
   c. Follow best practices for version control and code documentation.
